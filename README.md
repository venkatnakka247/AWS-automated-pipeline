#Automated Pipeline

This project orchestrates a data processing workflow using various AWS services, illustrated in the attached architecture diagram.

Architecture Overview
The pipeline consists of the following components:

S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Acts as the data lake or input bucket where source files are uploaded.

Lambda

An event-driven AWS serverless compute service triggers upon new S3 uploads.

Performs pre-processing or coordination tasks.

Glue

AWS Glue jobs/processes further transform and prepare the data.

Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.

EventBridge

Coordinates event-driven workflows and rules after Glue operation completion.

Routes events to downstream services.

SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Sends notifications (email/SMS/HTTP) based on EventBridge events.

Alerts users or downstream integrations of pipeline status.

CloudWatch

Centralized monitoring and logging for all pipeline components.

Collects metrics, logs, and sends alerts for failures or anomalies.

Workflow Steps
File Upload

User uploads a file/data to the designated S3 bucket.

Trigger Lambda

S3 event triggers the Lambda function.

Lambda may validate, pre-process, or initiate a Glue job.

Run Glue ETL

Lambda starts an AWS Glue job for ETL processing of uploaded data.

EventBridge Coordination

On Glue job completion, an event is sent to EventBridge.

EventBridge processes rules and triggers actions.

Send Notification via SNS

EventBridge triggers an SNS notification.

Notification sent to subscribed endpoints (email/SMS/HTTP).

Monitoring with CloudWatch

Every service logs activities and errors to CloudWatch.

Setup CloudWatch alarms as needed.

Setup Guide
S3 Bucket

Create an S3 bucket for storing input files.

Configure events to trigger Lambda on new file uploads.

Lambda Function

Create a Lambda function with required IAM permissions for S3 and Glue.

Ensure it is triggered by S3 upload events.

Glue Job

Define a Glue job for your data ETL requirements.

Lambda triggers this Glue job using the AWS SDK.

EventBridge Rule

Set up EventBridge rules to listen for Glue job status events (e.g., job completion).

Configure EventBridge to trigger SNS topics.

SNS Topic

Create SNS topics for notifications.

Subscribe users (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers) to these topics.

CloudWatch

Enable logging for Lambda, Glue, EventBridge, and SNS.

Create CloudWatch alarms for errors or anomalies.

Prerequisites
An AWS Account

IAM roles with appropriate permissions for S3, Lambda, Glue, EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch

AWS CLI or AWS Management Console access

Usage
Upload a file to the specified S3 bucket.

The pipeline will automatically process the file, send notifications, and log events.

Monitor CloudWatch for the status and operational health of the workflow.
